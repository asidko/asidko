### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ _I'm a_ Full Stack Developer by passion & profession. Most of the time I work with Kotlin/Java Spring + Angular based projects, but PHP and Python are not exception too.
- ðŸŒ± _I'm currently learning_ things related to Home automation; like to constantly dig into projects related to voice synthesis and speech recognition; configuring self-made assistant on my RPI4.
- ðŸ‘¯ _Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on_ projects that bring general benefit to people - could automate something or just entertain. I appreciate people who not just do their job, but always are looking for better ways to achieve a goal, who can't pass by bad written code, who are sincerely happy when everything in the project looks clean and is in good order.
- ðŸ“« _How to reach me_: Skype (letfar) or mail to sidkoo@outlook.com
